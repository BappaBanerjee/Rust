    //Data Types
    /*
    *   Rust is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable must be known at compile time.
    *   Rust has a strong type system, meaning that the type of a variable cannot be
    *   changed after it is set.
    *   Rust has a rich set of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers,
    *   booleans, characters, and strings.
    *   Rust also has compound data types, such as tuples and arrays.
    *   Rust has a powerful type inference system, meaning that the type of a variable can
    *   often be inferred by the compiler without needing to explicitly specify it.
    */

    //Scalar Types
    /*  
    *   Scalar types represent a single value.
    *   Rust has four primary scalar types: 
    *   integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters.
    *   Integers can be signed or unsigned, and can have different sizes
    *   (e.g., i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, u8, u16, u32, u64, u128).
    *   Floating-point numbers can be either f32 or f64.
    *   Booleans can be either true or false.
    *   Characters represent a single Unicode scalar value and are denoted by single quotes (e.g., 'a', '1', 'ðŸ˜Š').
    *   Rust also has a unit type (), 
    *   which represents an empty value and is used in functions that do not return a value.
    *   The unit type is often used as a placeholder in function signatures or when a function
    *   does not need to return a value.
    *   The unit type is also used in expressions that do not produce a value, such
    *   as when a function is called for its side effects.
    *   The unit type is often used in Rust to indicate that a function does not return
    *   a value, or that a value is not needed.
    *   The unit type is represented by the empty tuple ().

    //Compound Types
    /*
    *   Compound types can group multiple values into one type.
    *   Rust has two primary compound types: tuples and arrays.
    *   Tuples can hold values of different types and are defined using parentheses (e.g., (1, "hello", true)).
    *   Arrays hold values of the same type and are defined using square brackets (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
    *   Tuples can have a fixed size and can hold values of different types.
    *   Arrays can have a fixed size and can hold values of the same type.
    *   Tuples are useful for grouping related values together, while arrays are useful for storing
    *   collections of values of the same type.
