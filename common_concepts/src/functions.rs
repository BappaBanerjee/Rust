    // The above line will not compile because `let` is used incorrectly.
    // The correct way to use `let` is to declare a variable, not as part of an expression.
    // For example, you can write:
    let z = 6; // Correct usage of `let`
    println!("This will compile: {}", z);
    // This will compile successfully and print the value of z.
    // The error in the original line is due to trying to use `let` in a
    // context where an expression is expected, which is not allowed in Rust.
    // In Rust, `let` is used for variable binding and cannot be used as part
    // of an expression like this. Instead, you should use `let` to declare a
    // variable and then use that variable in expressions.
    // The correct way to write the original line would be:
    // let x = 6; // This is a valid variable declaration
    // println!("This will compile: {}", x);
    // This will compile successfully and print the value of x.
    // In summary, the original line will not compile because `let` is used incorrectly
    // in an expression context. The correct usage of `let` is to declare a variable
    // and then use that variable in expressions.
